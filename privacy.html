	<h1>Privacy Information - LucOS Authentication</h1>
	Please note that this information is only applicable to the LucOS authentication service.  Individual LucOS apps may go beyond what's covered here.
	<h2>Data Storage</h2>
	<p>The following data is logged and held temporarily on LucOS servers for the purposes of IT Security:
		<ul>
			<li>IP Addresses</li>
			<li>Browser information (known as a "User Agent String")</li>
			<li>A list of pages visited</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Requesting Data Deletion</h2>
	<p>If there's a legal requirement to delete certain data held on LucOS servers, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:data.privacy@l42.eu">data.privacy@l42.eu</a>, containing the following:
		<ul>
			<li>The exact data which needs deleted</li>
			<li>The legal requirement under which the data is to be deleted</li>
			<li>A hand-drawn picture of a dragon</li>
		</ul>
	Please don't email regarding data not held on LucOS servers nor under legal requirements which don't apply to LucOS.  (For example, GDPR has an exemption for "personal or household activities", which pretty much covers LucOS)  Such emails will be considered time-wasting and may be ignored, marked as spam or replied to in a brusque fashion.</p>
	<h2>Cookie Usage</h2>
	<p>LucOS Authentication sets cookies for the following purposes:
		<ul>
			<li>Remembering which LucOS app to return you to following login</li>
			<li>Remembering who you are so that you don't need to login multiple times across LucOS apps</li>
		</ul>
		If you disable cookies in your browser, hopefully login should still work.  However, you'll need to login again for every LucOS app.  Note that no guarantees are made, as this flow is rarely tested.
	</p>
	<h2>Retrival of data found elsewhere</h2>
	<p>
		LucOS Authentication attempts to match up information regarding the account you've used to login, with contacts stored elsewhere in the LucOS system.  This process doesn't create new contacts or store additional data on existing contacts.  Some LucOS apps ensure such a match has been found before considering a login successful.
	</p>
	<h2>Veracity of this document</h2>
	<p>
		Whilst attempts were made to ensure information contained in this document was correct at the time it was authored, no guarantees are made as to its veracity.  Also, changes to the system may be made without this document being updated, leading to potential inaccuracies.
